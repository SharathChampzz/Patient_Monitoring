# Patient_Monitoring

This Project is helpfull in collecting sensor data from more than one NodeMCU. And the data can be displayed in an android app.

Idea :
1.Nodemcu can host a website , So that Using AJAX sensor readings will be displayed on to the website . 
2.Nodemcu will hosta website on a particular IP that IP adress will be available in Arduino IDE serial monitor. 
3.Website can be acessed with in a network by typing the IP adress into the url box of any browser .[Acessible only in the same network].
4.Using webscrapping , displayed sensor data is send to python file.
5.From python file data is written to firebase
